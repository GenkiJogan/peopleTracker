uint8 numberOfPeople		# number of people detected in current scene
uint32[] peopleID				# array of unique IDs of detected people
float32[] x							# array of x-coordinates (in meter) of detected people expressed in the reference 	
													frame Ws (see	below).
float32[] y							# array of y-coordinates (in meter) of detected people expressed in the reference
													frame Ws (see	below).
float32[] vx						# array of x-velocities (in meter/second) of detected people which they have in the
													fixed absolute system, expressed in the reference frame Ws. That is, the x-velocities
													people have in the reference frame Ws, after having subtracted the movement of the
													robot.
float32[] vy						# array of y-velocities (in meter/second) of detected people which they have in the
													fixed absolute system, expressed in the reference frame Ws. That is, the y-velocities

Reference frame Ws:

It is a 2D reference frame with the following characteristics:
0) it lies on the floor plane;
1) the origin coincides with the orthogonal projection of the sensor reference frame origin onto the floor plane;
2) the y-axis is directed along the projection of the sensor optical axis onto the floor plane.
3) the x-axis is directed in such a way that the angle between the x-axis and the y-axis, measured counter-clockwise, is 90 degrees.

Note that reference frame Ws moves onto the floor plane accordingly to the sensor movements in 3D space.
