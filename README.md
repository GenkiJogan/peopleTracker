Small-footprint mobile ground robots, such as the popular [Turtlebot](http://www.turtlebot.com) and [Kobuki](http://kobuki.yujinrobot.com) platforms, are by necessity equipped with sensors which lie close to the ground. Reliably detecting and tracking people from this viewpoint is a challenging problem, whose solution is a key requirement for many applications involving sharing of common spaces and close human-robot interaction. Here you can find a robust solution for cluttered indoor environments, using an inexpensive RGB-D sensor such as the Microsoft Kinect or Asus Xtion. A MATLAB real-time ROS-enabled implementation is available on this git repository.

# Getting Started
The system is implemented in MATLAB, with the most computationally expensive tasks written as mex functions able to exploit multi-core CPUs thanks to OpenMP support.

## Requirements
The implementation has been tested under Mac OSX and Ubuntu Linux. In order to build and use the system, the following are required:
* MATLAB (tested on R2011b and R2013a)
* gcc compiler (version 4.7 or greater)
* [OpenNI 1.5](http://www.openni.org/openni-sdk/openni-sdk-history-2/) (not compatible with OpenNI 2)

## Installation
Compile mex functions from an OS terminal with the following command: `MATLABDIR="/path/to/matlab" OPENNIDIR="/path/to/openni/include" make`. 
Where `"/path/to/matlab"` is the MATLAB root directory, and where `"/path/to/openni/include"` is the OpenNI headers directory.
Up to this stage you can use the system:
* live: with an OpenNI compatible RGB-D sensor (tested with Microsft Kinect and Asus Xtion Pro Live), directly connected to computer where the system is running.
* recorded videos: with ".oni" files, previously recorded with an RGB-D sensor.

If you want to integrate the system in a ROS environment, reading sensor data on the topics *"/camera/depth_registered/image_raw"* and *"/camera/rgb/image_raw/compressed"*, reading odometry data on the topic *"/odom"* and publishing the traked people on the topic *"/people"* with message type *"people_msg/People"*, you need to perform the following additional steps:
* copy the entire people_msg directory into your `ROS_PACKAGE_PATH`
* cd to `ROS_PACKAGE_PATH`
* build the package with `rosmake people_msg`

## Usage
The files in the direcotry examples contain detailed explanations about the usage of the system with the various source type. To obtain more information about a particular function use the MATLAB command help.
